# Customer-and-Inventory-Management-Software
A digital storefront for tracking inventory and managing customers.

I applied back-end OOP data abstraction to design a database for retailers to adjust stock, modify prices and manage customer information.
I also designed a front-end user interface for customers to register personal data, manage purchases and shop available inventory.
Working on this project taught me how to access and manipulate data from locally stored files!
I recieved my school's Computer Science Award for my design and implementation of this software program.
